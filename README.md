[h1][b]++++ ANOMALIES ++++[/b][/h1]

[*] Territory Radius - Defines the area (in meters) the anomaly can freely move to engage its target(s). The anomaly will revert back to the spawn location when no threats active.
[*] Damage Inflicted - Percentage of damage inflicted by the anomaly to the players. (Percentages are converted to a range of 0 to 1).
